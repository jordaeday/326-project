                Destination: Vacation is a web application that helps users plan their next vacation. Users can input their desired destination, budget, and travel dates, and the application will provide them with a list of recommended activities, restaurants, and hotels. The application will also provide users with a map of their destination, as well as weather information and travel tips. Our goal is to make vacation planning easy and stress-free, so that users can focus on enjoying their trip.

                            I am a sophomore Computer Science major, and I am also pursuing a linguistics minor. I enjoy playing video games in my free time, and think game development would be something super fun to get into. I am familiar with Javascript, Java, C, C++, and Crystal (similar to Ruby). I’ve also done several projects outside of school, including a personal website, hackathon projects, and game mods. I’m also on the executive board of the UMass Debate Society, and I enjoy traveling around the New England area to compete at debate tournaments.

                            I am a sophomore computer science major with a math minor. Her hobbies include reading, playing tennis, and cooking (not well). I have limited web development experience, but have completed data science and bioinformatic projects in the past, mostly done in Python, R, and Jupyter. Other programming languages I know are Java, Javascript/TS, C, and SQL. On campus, I’m involved in the HackUMass organizing

                            I am a sophomore studying computer science. I enjoy reading and knitting my scarf! I have been coding since my freshman year of high school and am familiar with Java, Typescript/Javascript, Python, and C. A fun fact about me is I love teaching and have tutored and educated in mathematics for many years. Over breaks, I work at Mathnasium and help children of all ages strengthen their foundational skills.
