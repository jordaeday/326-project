          Destination: Vacation is a web application that helps users plan their
          next vacation. Users can input their desired destination, budget, and
          travel dates, and the application will provide them with a list of
          recommended activities, restaurants, and hotels. The application will
          also provide users with a map of their destination, as well as weather
          information and travel tips. Our goal is to make vacation planning
          easy and stress-free, so that users can focus on enjoying their trip.

                I am a sophomore Computer Science major, and I am also pursuing
                a linguistics minor. I enjoy playing video games in my free
                time, and think game development would be something super fun to
                get into. I am familiar with Javascript, Java, C, C++, and
                Crystal (similar to Ruby). I’ve also done several projects
                outside of school, including a personal website, hackathon
                projects, and game mods. I’m also on the executive board of the
                UMass Debate Society, and I enjoy traveling around the New
                England area to compete at debate tournaments.

                Python, and C. A fun fact about me is I love teaching and have
                tutored and educated in mathematics for many years. Over breaks,

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <div id="overview-text"><br>Our web application, Destination Vacation, is designed to transform vacation planning by addressing issues of information overload and decision fatigue. We plan to make finding flights, housing accommodations, itineraries easy, as navigating an unfamiliar city with new transportation, languages, and cultures is overwhelming. Further, budget constraints, climate preferences, language barriers, and VISA restrictions must be taken into account. </br>
        <br>For users who already have a destination in mind, users can access a comprehensive suite of information on the location, flights, hotels, dining options, and popular tourist attractions. For undecided users, we offer a quiz whose results are employed in a weighted average system that factors in budget, desired climate, language proficiency, and cultural interests. This allows recommendations to be aligned with the user’s values and interests, making it a relevant tool. </br>
        <br>The target audience is broad, encompassing seasoned and first-time travelers. We plan to offer a variety of sorting and filtering methods, which will also allow users to tailor results based on preferences and budget. By focusing on inclusivity and simplicity, Destination Vacation aims to serve as a platform for travelers seeking a hassle-free and enjoyable vacation planning experience, ensuring every journey is not a tedious chore, but a seamless adventure.</br>

      <section id="application-parts">
        <h2>Application Parts</h2>
        <div id="application-parts-text">
        <br>The interactive quiz is a fundamental feature of our application, as it is designed to simplify the challenge of finding a vacation destination. We plan to use a linear combination of user preferences, including budget, language, desired climate, accessibility needs, and cultural interests, and weights of these preferences based on how important they are to the user. Then, potential locations are ranked. This component introduces an element of discovery into our application, allowing users to find destinations they may not have previously considered but align well with their preferences. Rankings will also be able to be filtered, for those with additional requirements.</br>
        <br>Next, the flight selection page allows users to compare prices, flight duration, non-stop or connecting flights, and baggage allowances, streamlining the process of booking air travel. Users will also be able to select different airports, dates, and cabin classes. Sorting features, such as lowest to highest cost, will be available, ensuring travelers can find flights that best match their preferences and budget. To expand the real-world impact of our project, we will include measures such as the carbon footprint of a flight so users can be environmentally conscious when selecting transportation.</br>
        <br>Finally, our review system is a crucial component that offers authentic insights from our users, giving travelers more information on possible lodging, restaurants, and attractions. Unlike other platforms which may rely on external APIs for review, our system is populated with curated reviews written by our team or sourced from verified travelers in our community. This allows for reviews to be quality controlled before being available to the public, ensuring reliability and usefulness. This will enable travelers to make informed decisions based on reviews they can trust, hopefully enhancing the overall quality of their trip.</br>

        <h2>Real-World Connections</h2>
        <div id="real-world-text">
            <br>Planning a trip can be a stressful and overwhelming experience. Our website, Destination Vacation, tackles many of the concerns that come along with that daunting task. It aims to create an easier experience that excites users for their future travels, along with providing recommendations and inspiration for the vacation to come.</br>
            <br>One common issue is just figuring out where to go! For example, my friends and I wanted to take a trip recently, but struggled on finding a place that fit all our combined preferences. We had specific budgets and knew we wanted somewhere warm, but there were so many options and everything seemed out of our college student price range. Our website will have the option to take a quiz where users can input preferences such as languages spoken, flight budgets, weather, distance, and more. The result will provide information on several of their ideal vacations, possible flight bookings, and facts about the locations! </br>
            <br>Another feature we plan to implement is an educational one. Users should learn about a place prior to choosing it. Therefore, for each travel location, we want to include cultural information such as holidays being observed, unique events/celebrations, and how to be respectful when exploring local areas. We want users to immerse themselves and to be knowledgeable about the places they go. Finally, a handy detail included is a translation option for the website. Users should be able to navigate in the language most familiar to them as this website is intended for travel from anywhere. </br>

        <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
        <div id="integrative-experience-text">
            Our project leverages the diverse skill sets acquired by each team member throughout our academic journeys. The Integrative Experience requirement involves two key aspects: first, integrating general education classes and coursework into a student's major-related experiences, and applying this knowledge to real-world scenarios; second, following essential learning objectives such as collaboration, communication, and critical thinking. Our project meets the first aspect by incorporating our academic interests and general education coursework. For instance, Jordan's studies in linguistics, both for general education requirements and personal interest, contribute to our quiz aimed at assessing the ease or difficulty of traveling to a destination where the user doesn't speak the local language. For instance, Spanish speakers often find it relatively easy to communicate with Italian or Portuguese speakers due to linguistic similarities. We address the second aspect by fostering collaboration within the team and considering challenges individuals might encounter when traveling to new locales. This necessitates critical thinking and effective communication among team members to gain diverse perspectives and ensure comprehensive problem-solving.
