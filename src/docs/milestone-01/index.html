          Destination: Vacation is a web application that helps users plan their
          next vacation. Users can input their desired destination, budget, and
          travel dates, and the application will provide them with a list of
          recommended activities, restaurants, and hotels. The application will
          also provide users with a map of their destination, as well as weather
          information and travel tips. Our goal is to make vacation planning
          easy and stress-free, so that users can focus on enjoying their trip.

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <div id="overview-text"><br>Our web application, Destination Vacation, aims to change the way individuals plan their well-deserved vacation by addressing the real world problems of information overload and decision fatigue. Many pieces have to come together for a vacation to go smoothly- flights, housing accommodations, itineraries, and navigating an unfamiliar city with new transportation, languages, and cultures. Potential travelers, understandably, are easily overwhelmed and miss out on exploring great locations due to this. Budget constraints, climate preferences, language barriers, and VISA restrictions are also important factors to take into account. Our application is meant for both decisive and indecisive travelers, offering a personalized approach to simplify planning their dream vacation. </br>
        <br>For users who already have a destination in mind, our application serves as a one-stop-shop, providing comprehensive information on the location as well as flights, hotels, dining options, and popular tourist attractions. For users who are uncertain of their next destination, we will integrate a quiz whose results will be used in a weighted average system that considers personal preferences such as budget, desired climate, language proficiency, and cultural interests. This approach ensures recommendations are aligned with the user’s values and interests, making it a relevant and useful tool in the vacation planning process.</br>
        <br>The target audience is broad, encompassing seasoned and first-time travelers. We plan to offer a variety of sorting and filtering methods, which will also allow users to personalize their own experience based on what they are looking for and what they are willing to spend on. By focusing on inclusivity and personal preferences, Destination Vacation aims to serve as a platform for travelers seeking an efficient, enjoyable, and tailored vacation planning experience, ensuring every journey is not a tedious chore, but a seamless adventure.</br>

      <section id="application-parts">
        <h2>Application Parts</h2>
        <div id="application-parts-text">
        <br>The interactive quiz is a fundamental feature of our application, as it is designed to simplify the challenge of finding a vacation destination. By combining user preferences, including budget, language, desired climate, accessibility needs, and cultural interests, and weighing these preferences against how important they are to the user, the tool personalizes the search process. We plan to use a linear combination to create a score based on these parts, allowing us to rank potential destinations for users. This component introduces an element of discovery into our application, allowing users to find destinations they may not have previously considered but align well with their preferences. Rankings will also be able to be filtered, for those with additional requirements.</br>
        <br>Next, the flight selection page allows users to compare prices, flight duration, non-stop or connecting flights, and baggage allowances, streamlining the process of booking air travel. Users will also be able to select different airports, dates, and cabin classes. Sorting features, such as lowest to highest cost, will be available, ensuring travelers can find flights that best match their preferences and budget. To expand the real-world impact of our project, we will include measures such as the carbon footprint of a flight so users can be environmentally conscious when selecting transportation. Finally, we hope to integrate a price alert and prediction feature, which can alert users that sign up to the best time to book based on previous price fluctuation.</br>
        <br>Finally, our review system is a crucial component that offers authentic insights from our users, giving travelers more information on possible lodging, restaurants, and attractions. Unlike other platforms which may rely on external APIs for review, our system is populated with curated reviews written by our team or sourced from verified travelers in our community. This allows for reviews to be quality controlled before being available to the public, ensuring reliability and usefulness. This will enable travelers to make informed decisions based on reviews they can trust, hopefully enhancing the overall quality of their trip.</br>

      <section id="data-requirements">
        <h2>Data Requirements</h2>
        <div id="data-requirements-text">
          As vacation planning comprises of many parts, our data requirements are robust, and we will combine multiple different sources of data to streamline the process for users.
          <br><br>
          First, we plan to use an API to gather flight data, which is necessary for the flight section of our application to function. Users will be able to enter their initial and destination airport and dates they want to travel, then be given a list of potential flights. We need to constantly update our information to keep our flights up to date for users. Using this data, we will provide users with all available flights’ prices, lengths, airlines, and whether they have connections. Using historical flight data, we can even tell them when flights are predicted to be cheapest or are currently lower than normal.
          <br><br>
          We also hope to create a database of locations our website will handle, which will consist of popular travel cities of all kinds and climates. Users will be able to choose from these places to explore or have the option to take a quiz assigning them their ideal trip. We will gather current information for all these cities using different API’s (flights, languages, attractions, hotels, etc).
          <br><br>
          For hotels, restaurants, and attractions, we plan to use geographic information to pull lists of high-rated establishments. We will also include operating hours so that users can plan out their travel days accordingly. Places will be tagged with descriptions such as nature, art, and historical, so that users can filter by their interests.
          <br><br>
          Also, to fit their weather preferences and make sure that the user can do all of the activities they want, we will use a weather API for up to date weather predictions. It is important to consider weather when it comes to destination as that dictates the user’s itinerary. 
          <br><br>
          Our website will need to handle many different data and remain up to date for a stress-free and informative planning experience.

          <img src="wireframes/wire-frame-1.png" alt="Wireframe 1" />
          This is the home/landing page of our website. It will include a
          navigation bar for popular pages, a quick link to our location quiz,
          and a button that allows the user to select a certain location. Under
          the header, there will be images of features of the website (like a
          hotel finder) alongside a quick link to that page.

          This is our quiz that matches users with a destination for their
          vacation. It says what page of the quiz the user is on in the top left, 
          and has a bar at the bottom to show the same information visually.

        <div class="wire-frames-text" id="wire-frames-3">
          <img src="wireframes/wire-frame-3.png" alt="Wireframe 3" />
          This shows the results of the quiz. It will show the user the top
          choices for their vacation destination, and allow them to click on a
          location to learn more about it. It also shows how much of a match
          each location is to the user's preferences.

          It has an image, as well as a brief description of the location, its
          attractions, flights, etc., as well as links to see more in-depth 
          information about each of these.

        <h2>Real-World Connections</h2>
        <div id="real-world-text">
            <br>Planning a trip can be a stressful and overwhelming experience. Our website, Destination Vacation, tackles many of the concerns that come along with that daunting task. It aims to create an easier experience that excites users for their future travels, along with providing recommendations and inspiration for the vacation to come.</br>
            <br>One common issue is just figuring out where to go! For example, my friends and I wanted to take a trip recently, but struggled on finding a place that fit all our combined preferences. We had specific budgets and knew we wanted somewhere warm, but there were so many options and everything seemed out of our college student price range. Our website will have the option to take a quiz where users can input preferences such as languages spoken, flight budgets, weather, distance, and more. The result will provide information on several of their ideal vacations, possible flight bookings, and facts about the locations! </br>
            <br>Another feature we plan to implement is an educational one. Users should learn about a place prior to choosing it. Therefore, for each travel location, we want to include cultural information such as holidays being observed, unique events/celebrations, and how to be respectful when exploring local areas. We want users to immerse themselves and to be knowledgeable about the places they go. Finally, a handy detail included is a translation option for the website. Users should be able to navigate in the language most familiar to them as this website is intended for travel from anywhere. </br>

      <section id="integrative-experience">
        <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
        <div id="integrative-experience-text">
            Our project leverages the diverse skill sets acquired by each team member throughout our academic journeys. The Integrative Experience requirement involves two key aspects: first, integrating general education classes and coursework into a student's major-related experiences, and applying this knowledge to real-world scenarios; second, following essential learning objectives such as collaboration, communication, and critical thinking. Our project meets the first aspect by incorporating our academic interests and general education coursework. For instance, Jordan's studies in linguistics, both for general education requirements and personal interest, contribute to our quiz aimed at assessing the ease or difficulty of traveling to a destination where the user doesn't speak the local language. For instance, Spanish speakers often find it relatively easy to communicate with Italian or Portuguese speakers due to linguistic similarities. We address the second aspect by fostering collaboration within the team and considering challenges individuals might encounter when traveling to new locales. This necessitates critical thinking and effective communication among team members to gain diverse perspectives and ensure comprehensive problem-solving.
